## Data Sources

The application reads directly from Unity Catalog Delta tables in Databricks:

- **Issues Table**: `lakehouse_inn_catalog.voc.open_issues_diagnosis`
  - Contains open issues identified across all properties
  - Tracks location, aspect, severity, status, volume, and more
  - Powers property diagnostics, flagged properties list, and recommendations
  - Updated in real-time as new issues are detected

All services use a shared `DatabaseService` that:
- Connects to Databricks SQL Warehouse for high-performance queries
- Implements connection pooling and 5-minute caching for optimal performance
- Authenticates using Databricks SDK credentials
- Supports both dictionary and pandas DataFrame output formats
- **Graceful fallback**: Automatically uses placeholder data if Databricks connection fails
  - Ensures app remains functional during development or connectivity issues
  - Warning messages displayed in terminal when using placeholder data

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `example.env` to `.env`
   - Fill in your actual Databricks credentials:
     - `DATABRICKS_HOST`
     - `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID` 
     - `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET`
     - `DATABRICKS_SQL_WAREHOUSE_PATH` (SQL warehouse HTTP path, e.g., `/sql/1.0/warehouses/xxxxx`)
     - `LAKEBASE_INSTANCE_NAME`
     - `LAKEBASE_DB_NAME`
     - `MY_EMAIL`
     - `GENIE_SPACE_ID` (your Databricks Genie space ID)
     - `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` (optional - personal access token for Genie access)

3. Run the Dash application:
   ```bash
   python dash_app.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Using Placeholder Data

If you see messages like "üìä Using placeholder data for property service" in the terminal:

- The app is running with **mock data** because it cannot connect to Databricks
- The app remains fully functional with placeholder data for all features
- Common causes:
  - `DATABRICKS_SQL_WAREHOUSE_PATH` not set in `.env`
  - Invalid SQL warehouse path
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Incorrect Databricks credentials

### Verifying Database Connection

To verify your Databricks connection is working:

1. Check the terminal output when the app starts
2. If using **real data**, you'll see property names from your actual Delta table
3. If using **placeholder data**, you'll see warning messages and mock properties (Denver, Miami, Chicago, Austin, Seattle)

### Getting Help

- Check that all environment variables are set correctly in `.env`
- Verify your SQL warehouse is running in Databricks
- Ensure your service principal has proper permissions:
  - `CAN USE` on the SQL warehouse
  - `SELECT` permission on `lakehouse_inn_catalog.voc.open_issues_diagnosis`
