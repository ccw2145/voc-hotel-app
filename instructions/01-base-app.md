# Build the base of an app

https://apps-cookbook.dev/docs/fastapi/getting_started/create

Make me a simple FastAPI app (in the root of the project) that serves a hello world index.html file (in /frontend).
have the FastAPI app load the env file.
the app runs directly with uvicorn and listens on port 8000.

don't worry about setting up virtual environments or packages, i will handle it.

Screen 1: Real Time Diagnostics
button to kick off a workspace that shows Anomaly Detection and Summary for All Properties 
KPI for each aspect/location: 7 day average of negative shares reviews (by percentage) to flag issues
(Reading from a table populated daily)

Screen 2: Property Health Dashboard
shows charts with KPIs, and Genie to query gold table

Screen 3: Location Detail + Proposed Email
Summary View: drop down to select a location, shows checks done on all aspects (summary)
For flagged aspects: Prescriptive Recommendations & Communication Generation (email that can be sent directly)

the property details to dynamically update based on the dropdown selection.
